#### Hi! Welcome to my Github and Stackexchange activities(tik9.github.io) &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<i class="fas fa-thumbs-up fa-2x"></i>

<br><br>

#### What is this site about?

Off the top of my head: 
It is about..

.. myself:
- Javascript Developer
- Full Stack Developer

It is also about..

..showing my Github and Stackexchange activities.

Both companies do their job well:

Github is complex regarding user interaction and you have several possibilities including a static site for each repo. Although I must admit I never did much on Bitbucket, which should be worthwhile inspecting. But for another day..

Stackexchange is an independent company and is in social coding. I post and comment here and there.

#### Things I learn while making the site
- Game development (2D Breakout Game with JS)
- Htmlproofer (`htmlproofer --assume-extension _site` is my favorite), Travis &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<img src='assets/travis.png' width=150px alt ='travis-img' />
- VSCode skills - a tool I will not miss

Apropos JS, what I used


Function|Page|Comment
-|-|-
listener scroll button|all|works only if needed / if page has content to scroll
Stackexchange api|Stackexchange|maybe it can be pulled before showing the page
Github repo api|Github|in planning: jekyll-github-metadata plugin with GitHub API version 3

#### Things I miss
Python! Python..? Yes, Python. 

The essence: this website is done and based around a static site generator (ssg), so be calm, young horse, and go for other (Python) projects if you like Python.
