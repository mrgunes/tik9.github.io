#### Hi! Welcome to my Github and Stackexchange activities(tik9.github.io)<span style="display:inline-block; width: 50px;"></span><i class="fas fa-thumbs-up fa-2x"></i>

<br><br>

#### What is this site about?

Off the top of my head: 
It is about..

.. myself:
- Javascript Developer
- Full Stack Developer

It is also about..

..showing my Github and Stackexchange activities.

Both are different:

1. Github 
- it is complex regarding user interaction
- You have several possibilities including a static site for each repo
- Although I must admit I never did much on Bitbucket, which should be worthwhile inspecting. But for another day..

<br>
2. Stackexchange

#### Things I learn while making the site

- Htmlproofer (`htmlproofer --assume-extension _site` is my favorite), Travis hopefully soon <span style="display:inline-block; width: 50px;"></span><img src='assets/travis.png' width=150px alt ='travis-img' />
- VSCode skills - a tool I will not miss

Apropos JS, what I used


Function|Page|Comment
-|-|-
Game development | Breakout | code taken from MDN (Mozilla) and w3school
Github repo api|Github|in planning: jekyll-github-metadata plugin with GitHub API version 3
Listener scroll button | All | reacts to length of page
Stackexchange api | Stackexchange | can be improved

#### Things I miss
Python! Python..? Yes, Python. <i class="fab fa-python fa-2x"></i>

This website is done off a static site generator (ssg) and JS, so be calm, young horse, and go for other (Python) projects if you like Python.
